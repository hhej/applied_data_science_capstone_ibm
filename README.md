# IBM Applied D.S Capstone Project [ Finding My New Home in London ]
This repository contains my approach to solving the business problems of the Coursera course Applied Data Science Capstone offered by IBM. 

## Business Problems
The questions I aim to answer in this project are the following:

1. List and visualize all major parts of London with top existing infrastructure.
2. Which areas have the lowest crime rate and population?
3. What is the best place to stay within a city for all vital infrastructure facilities?

## Code
An ipython notebook is used for data preprocessing, machine learning analysis and data visualiation. 
All main scripts are in TheBattleOfNeighborhoods.ipynb file. 

## Note
I build this capstone undertaking to give you a sample of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 
It uses location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. 
This task exhibits how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve information about venues in different neighborhoods around the globe. 
I have used Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data. 
At long last, I have utilized the Folium library to extraordinary maps of geospatial information and to impart my outcomes and discoveries.
